--ðŸ“Œ AND in MySQL

Definition:

The AND operator in MySQL is a logical operator used inside the WHERE clause.

It is used to combine two or more conditions.

Working:

All conditions joined with AND must be true for the row to be selected (or updated/deleted).

If even one condition is false, the entire result becomes false.

Truth Table of AND:

Condition 1	Condition 2	Result
TRUE	TRUE	TRUE
TRUE	FALSE	FALSE
FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Usage:

Commonly used in WHERE clause to filter data.

Helps in applying multiple restrictions at the same time.

âœ… In short:
The AND operator is used to check multiple conditions together, and a row is included only if all the conditions are true.
