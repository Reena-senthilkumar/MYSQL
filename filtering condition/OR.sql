ðŸ“Œ OR in MySQL

Definition:

The OR operator in MySQL is a logical operator used inside the WHERE clause.

It is used to combine two or more conditions.

Working:

If any one condition is true, the whole OR condition becomes true.

Only when all conditions are false, the result becomes false.

Truth Table of OR:

Condition 1	Condition 2	Result
TRUE	TRUE	TRUE
TRUE	FALSE	TRUE
FALSE	TRUE	TRUE
FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Usage:

Commonly used in WHERE clause to allow flexible filtering.

Helps in selecting rows that satisfy at least one condition.

âœ… In short:
The OR operator is used when you want to select rows that satisfy any one of multiple conditions.
