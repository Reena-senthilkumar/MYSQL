1. What is a View?
A View is a virtual table created from an existing table.

CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT columns FROM table;


View does not store data;
it only stores the SELECT query logic.

  Is a View a Table?

A view LOOKS like a table,
but it is NOT a real physical table.

It is only a virtual table created from an existing table.

  Can we 'print' the student table from the view?
✔️ YES

    there are tow types of views
    Updatable Views vs Non-Updatable Views

Some views allow INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
Some do NOT allow modification.

  ✔ UPDATABLE VIEWS

These views allow:

INSERT

UPDATE

DELETE

on the view → which updates the original table.

📌 Conditions for an Updatable View

A view is updatable only if the SELECT query is simple:

✔ Based on one table
✔ No group by
✔ No having
✔ No distinct
✔ No aggregate functions (SUM, AVG…)
✔ No set operations (UNION, INTERSECT…)
✔ No subqueries in SELECT
✔ No joins
✔ No expressions on columns

🎯 Example: Updatable View

Table: Employees

View:

/*CREATE VIEW emp_hr AS
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, salary
FROM Employees
WHERE department = 'HR';*/


This view is updatable.

Because it is:

From one table

Simple WHERE condition

So you can do:

/*UPDATE emp_hr
SET salary = 60000
WHERE emp_id = 1;*/


This changes the original table.
